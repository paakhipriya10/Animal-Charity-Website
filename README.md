## Summary

This project offers a seamless interface for animal lovers and supporters to contribute to conservation efforts. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the site is optimized for performance, accessibility, and real-world usability.

## Problem Statement

Many animal welfare organizations lack a strong digital presence and tools to facilitate real-time donations and data collection. Without such platforms, it's hard to reach modern-day donors or share transparent progress updates.

---

## Solution Approach

The Animal Charity website solves this by offering:
- A visually engaging frontend to tell the charityâ€™s story
- Real-time donation tracking connected to MongoDB
- A clean UI for donors to contribute and send messages
- Persistent backend logic to store donor and contact data
- A donation goal progress bar and animal impact estimator
- UPI option for Indian donors and a contact form for outreach
